# CHALLENGE 6

Probably one of the most famous algorithms ever discovered us the *Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm*, but still lot of people struggle when trying to find an efficient solution to generate this using JavaScript. Your goal is the following:

#### Given a number N return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:

> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
